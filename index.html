    HTML stands for <b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b>,<br>
      and the web was created in the 1990s with around 30 billion pages!<br><br>
    <p>It basically works like this: The end user, me, you, computer, etc. sends a request via http through the internet to a server, that server then grants the request and sends it back through the internet to me.</p><br><br> HTML is the heart of the web and is made up of various parts such as:<br> Text content:<b>what you see</b><br>Mark-up:<b>what it looks like</b><br>References to other documents:<b>e.g. images and videos</b><br> Links to other pages.</p>
  <p>More complex HTML will feature attributes like <a href="reddit.com"> links</a>, and images:<br><br> - <img src="http://i.imgur.com/QzVErF6.png" alt="BigBoss"></p>
  <p>We also learn the difference between <em>inline and block elements</em>.<br> <b>Inline</b> does not create a new block of content, such as the span tag, or the break tag, where as <b>Block</b> will create a new block of content, such as the paragraph tag, or the div tag. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>
  <p>Finally, we also learn computers are "stupid". Not in the sense that they cannot complete simple tasks, but in that the smallest mistake can cause the biggest of issues. However, if we learn how to speak/code correctly we can make computers do amazing things</p>
